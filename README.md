## About Cleanroom

Cleanroom is a utility that we use in order to run curl and httpie without having to install and configure them on the host machine. 

### About Curl

> *From [the official website](https://curl.haxx.se/):*

curl is used in command lines or scripts to transfer data. It is also used in cars, television sets, routers, printers, audio equipment, mobile phones, tablets, settop boxes, media players and is the internet transfer backbone for thousands of software applications totally affecting more than one billion users.

### About HTTPie

> *From [the official readme](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie#readme):*

HTTPie (pronounced aych-tee-tee-pie) is a *command line HTTP client*.
Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible.
It provides a simple http command that allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple and natural syntax,
and displays colorized responses. HTTPie can be used for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with HTTP servers.
